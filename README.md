# CGG_Hackathon - Core Image Segmentation

## Project Overview
Thin Section Quality Screening: Scoring image quality using machine learning techniques on thin sections.
This project focuses on the segmentation of core images to aid in the analysis of geological samples. The objective is to develop methods that can automatically segment and analyze core sample images, providing valuable insights into their composition and properties.

## Achievements
**Award:** This project proudly achieved **Second Place** in GPS (Imperial College Londonâ€™s Geophysics Society) x CGG Seismic Hackathon

## Features
- **Data Visualization:** Visual tools for inspecting core images.
- **Image Processing:** Implementation of algorithms to segment core images into meaningful sections.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3.x, along with the following libraries:
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV (for image processing)
- Segment Anything

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git  #segment anything installation
pip install opencv-python pycocotools matplotlib onnxruntime onnx # dependancies 
```
